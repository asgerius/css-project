<h2>4. Sentiment Analysis and Loved Languages</h2>

<p>
    One might suspect that people in general are more positive when asking and answering questions about technologies that they like.
    The purpose of this section is to figure out if that is indeed the case:
    Is there a positive correlation between sentiment and how beloved a language is according to the developer survey?

            To do this, we use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/vader-sentiment/">VADER</a> for analyzing sentiments.
            VADER uses both dictionary based methods and context to calculate sentiments given a text piece, which helps it achieve useful results.

            First, we look at the overall distribution of sentiments.
            It is not surprising that are large amount of sentiments are precisely 0 (24 % to be exact), as a large amount objective language is expected.

            We have used the belovedness scores from the 2020 survey.
            As most of our data is older, we make sure no temporal differences exist, so that the comparison with sentiment scores makes sense.
            As the figure shows, there is little variation over time.
            The grey lines are for each individual langauge, and while variant, they overall change little.
            Over the entire dataset, the variance is negligible.
