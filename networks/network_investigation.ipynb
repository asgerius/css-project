    "# Network Analysis\n",

    "#### The following steps are taken in this part of the Stack Overflow investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create individual networks for each programming language with authors as nodes and interactions (answering questions or commenting answers) as links.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform basic network analysis (counts, degree distribution etc.) on language-specific networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create one all-encompasing, StackOverflow-network including all 16 programming languages with same types of nodes and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform basic network analysis on the StackOverflow-network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vizualize the StackOverflow-network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform advanced network analysis on the StackOverflow-network by investigating the different subnetworks, communities, modularity etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Louvain algorithm to create a network from the data and compare to the StackOverflow-network.\n",
